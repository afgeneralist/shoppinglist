To complete this challenge requires:

Using DOM manipulation and traversal to dynamically add and remove HTML elements and apply styles.
Linking to an externally hosted library (jQuery) and an locally hosted JavaScript file (app.js).
Using this and event delegation


Requirements
In terms of user experience, your shopping list app must allow users to:

1. enter items they need to purchase by entering text and   hitting "Return" or clicking the "Add item" button


2. check and uncheck items on the list by clicking the "Check" button

function Check
validate status of check (if statement) then toggleclass appropriatlely. 
Name of class (.shopping-item__checked) for linethrough styling


3. permanently remove items from the list
Parse up the DOM tree with .closest & then delete <li> element





Additionally:

- You must use a CDN-hosted version of jQuery
- Put your application code in a file called app.js and link to it in index.html
Hint: you may find it helpful to read up on and use the following jQuery methods: .submit(), preventDefault(), toggleClass(), and closest().
